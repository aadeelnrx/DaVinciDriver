Open issues:
- the Pololu footprint needs to be wider (500 mil wide, currently it's
 300 mil)
- the Teensy USB port will collide with the 7805 unless we really
 mount the 7805 horizontally as indicated in the PCB editor.
 But then it sticks out quite a bit.
- the pads for the car speed sensor (what I call encoder) are too
 close on the PCB
- some of the Teensy pins on the underside ("in the middle") are used
 on the PCB.  However, we cannot connect them easily/reliably.
- connect resistors to i2c bus of bno055?
 =====> I have that on my board, doesn't harm :-)
- we should change all pads to the same style and size (ok, bigger ones
 for the jumpers because the drill hole is also larger).  Pads
 should not be too small (the ones on the resistors are too small)
 because they are harder to manufacture and to solder.  Since we buy
 cheap PCBs I don't know their tolerances, so better use bigger pads.
 I have to find good inner/outer diameters.


???:
- The power on the Schmitt trigger is labelled "-5V" and on the BNO
  it's labelled "-3.3V".  They should be changed to +5V and +3.3V.
  => I see only + no - ?!?!?!
- I would be happier with the 100 nF left of the 7805 and a few 
 uF (10 uF for example) right of the 7805
  => even if spec says 0.1 uF on the left? let's discuss
  => goldcap added on the right
- the BNO footprint is also wider in reality.  Maybe we can leave
 out the "left" pin row, but I'm not sure if that is mechanically
 stable enough.  However, we could fix it mechanically if needed.
  => can be moved as needed


DONE:
- not decided yet where to connect R4 (engine voltage)
 ====> to pin 3 of the Pololu
- all the V+ need to be connected, somehow he didn't do it by himself
 ===> the V+ are all connected, V+ should be the 12V behind the diode.
      It currently is before the diode (as I had it in my earlier
      schematics, but V+ must be behind the diode, otherwise the 
      Pololu and the ADC in the Teensy will get reverse voltage
      when the track power is reversed polarity).
      ===> move V+ behind the diode  
- connect capacitor to nrf24 ?
 =====> good idea, at least 100 nF ceramic
- how to add power/gnd pins to 74hc14
 ====> right-click on the HC14, choose "Invoke", then "PWRN".  Place
       it onto the schematic and connect Vcc and GND.

- I didn't understand the pololu STBY pin, for now I just added a pin/hole (JP10)
 ====> connect to 3.3V to enable the driver all the time
  => connected to PIN 20
- we can change R2 and R4 from 3k to 3.3k, it's easier to buy and a
 safe change as it lowers the voltage on the ADC
  => DONE
- connect goldcap to 7805?
 =====> definitely, otherwise the Teensy might reset while driving
  => DONE
- the diodes at the Teensy (to select between USB and regulator
 voltage) need to be added
  => DONE
- the SPI and I2C connections need to be added to the schematic,
 and the connections from Pololu to Teensy as well
  => DONE, just invisible ;-)
- all free pins should maybe be made available
 =====> with space problems we can still solder to the pads on the
        PCB as I do now on the Lochrasterplatine
